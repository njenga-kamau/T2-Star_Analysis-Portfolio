# T2-Star_Analysis-Portfolio

This repository presents the analysis and code used for the study titled "Combined MR volumetry and relaxometry reveals the olfactory system as a critical iron-dependent structure affected by radiation". The study investigates the effects of whole-brain irradiation on adult mice, focusing on T2* MRI metrics sensitive to iron accumulation. The repository provides a detailed breakdown of the analysis pipeline, from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and visualization.

Introduction:
This study explores the neuroanatomical impact of radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI), with an emphasis on the olfactory system as a sensitive iron-dependent structure. Using advanced T2* MRI relaxometry, over 600 brain regions were analyzed for significant changes in volume and iron accumulation a year post-radiation.

Project Structure:
The repository includes the following directories:

Data Loading: Scripts and sample data for importing MRI datasets and neuroanatomical labels.
Data Cleaning: Procedures for pre-processing raw T2* maps and volumetric data.
Feature Extraction: Code for generating regional T2* and volume metrics from MRI data.
Statistical Analysis: Python scripts leveraging libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Seaborn for identifying statistically significant changes.
Visualization: Notebooks for creating heatmaps, z-score plots, and correlation analyses of affected regions.
Analysis Workflow
Data Loading:

Imported MRI datasets and aligned them with the P56 Mouse Brain atlas.
Applied high-order B0 shimming for field uniformity and registered anatomical images.
Preprocessing:

Generated T2* maps using a 2D multi-echo GRE sequence.
Co-registered maps to anatomical images to isolate neuroanatomical structures.
Statistical Analysis:

Conducted t-tests to identify regions with significant differences in volume and T2* relaxation.
Computed z-scores and performed correlation analysis to cross-reference affected regions.
Visualization:

Generated heatmaps of significant regions.
Highlighted the strong correlation between T2* relaxation and volume loss in the olfactory system.
Results Highlights
Identified 18 neuroanatomical subregions with significant changes in both volume and T2* relaxation.
The olfactory system exhibited the most pronounced changes, potentially linking iron accumulation to cognitive decline post-radiation.
